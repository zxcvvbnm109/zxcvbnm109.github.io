###### Task 2

```
Q: Click on "View Site" and answer the five questions. What is the flag that you obtained at the end?

A: THM{CIA_TRIAD}
```

Going beyond the CIA triad we have:
- authenticity - Not fraudulent. Ensures that the data is from the claimed source.
- nonrepudiation- Repudiation means refusing to recognize the validity of something. Nonrepudiation ensures, that the original source cannot deny they are the source of data.

###### Task 3

The opposite of CIA triad is DAD:
- disclosure - opposite of confidentiality
- alteration- opposite of integrity
- destruction / denial - opposite of availability
